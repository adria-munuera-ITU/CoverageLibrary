# Coverage Library [WIP]

This is a small library for Android whose objective is to gather data about the network quality (whether there is mobile signal and of what strength, what quality does the cellular data have...) so that later people are able to understand where there are coverage gaps or easy to improve signal.

This library is easy configurable to point the data to your desired endpoint. By default, it sends the data to the Giga-ITU servers to gather coverage data. 

You can find the repository for the API in this other repo.
